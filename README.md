Brain MRI Tumor Segmentation(Global Otsu vs Sauvola Adaptive Thresholding)

Project Overview:

The objective is to analyze and evaluate:

Global Otsu Thresholding

Sauvola Adaptive Thresholding

Segmentation performance is evaluated using:

Dice Coefficient

Jaccard Index (IoU)

The goal is to understand the behavior of global vs adaptive thresholding methods in complex medical imaging scenarios.
